about_tt_1 = "Kokoon Pueblo is a small-scale boutique development consisting of 8 villas and 2 apartments, which includes private gardens, rooftops and private pools, combining the comfort and privacy of a home with the security of a condo. <br><br> It also features common areas such as a central patio with a swimming pool and a lounge area where the flora plays an essential element, which is why approximately 65% of the jungle and endemic species will be preserved, providing each house magnificent views. <br><br> Its materials stem from the re-evaluation of the methods used by the Mayan culture, such as stone coating which functions as thermal insulator, natural stucco, certified Jamaican dogwood (Piscidia piscipula), as well as spacious, comfortable and luminous interiors which are open to the gardens in order to maintain their freshness."
